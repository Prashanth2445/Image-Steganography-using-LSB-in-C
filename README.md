# Image-Steganography-using-LSB-in-C
This project implements Image Steganography using the Least Significant Bit (LSB) technique. The goal is to hide a secret message file inside a .BMP image without changing how the image looks visually.  Steganography helps to securely conceal information inside media, making the communication undetectable.
